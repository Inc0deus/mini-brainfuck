# mini-brainfuck
A small brainfuck interpreter ('mini_brainfuck.py') in Python

'mini_brainfuck' is 318 caracters long
The main table has (as in the original) 30000 slots available, but can contain any integer (not limited to 8 bits numbers)

There is also a larger interpreter ('interpreter.py') with error handling and a real terminal interface, wich displays the inputs and outputs properly as well as the main table.
The file also contain all the instruction available in brainfuck and an example program of 'hello world'

Finally, there is an 'hello world' ('hello.bf') written in brainfuck (I think my idea is similar to what is presented in the Wikipedia page)
