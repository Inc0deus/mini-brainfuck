A small brainfuck interpreter («mini_brainfuck.py») in Python

'mini_brainfuck' is 318 characters. The main table has (as in the original) 30000 slots available, but can hold any integer (not limited to 8 bits).

There is also a larger interpreter ("interpreter.py") with error handling and a real terminal interface, which correctly displays inputs and outputs as well as the main table. The file also contains all the instructions available in brainfuck.

Finally, there is a 'hello world' ('hello.bf') written in brainfuck, my idea is similar to what is presented in the [Wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) page. (This file is used to test the call of Brainfuck’s files in the interpreter)
